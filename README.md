# linux_essential_commands
CLI program that helps linux beginners learn some basic commands

### Hi!

To build this program, clone the repository and run `cargo build --release`. Then, you can find the executable in `/target/release/linux_essential_commands`.

In order to build the program you must first have `rust` installed. I know this isn't ideal, and proper program distribution is still WIP.

Anyone is free to contribute.
