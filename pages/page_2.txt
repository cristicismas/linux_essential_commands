Second command, and possibly the most important one: <man>

While <ls> might seem like a simple command, like many linux commands, it has many options and it is much more powerful than you might think.

Whenever you want to find a command's options or advanced usage, there is another command to help you out: <man>, short for <manual>.

This command will display all of the options that a command has, and a summary about what it does.

To exit the program, use <Ctrl + C>. This is the shortcut you usually use to close terminal programs in linux.

Type <man ls> and see what happens.
