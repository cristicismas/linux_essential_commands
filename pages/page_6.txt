Making directories: <mkdir>

I think you know the drill by now, use <mkdir> like the last few commands: <mkdir my_directory>.

You can also use <absolute> and <relative paths> with this command, and to find out more options you can use <man>.

The <manual page> contains many useful <flags>, which you can think of as program <'arguments'>.

You can recognize flags by looking if they are prepended with a <hyphen> (<->)

One very useful flag for this command is <-p>, which helps you create <nested directories>. For example: <mkdir -p first/second/third>.
