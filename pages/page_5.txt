Making files: <touch>

Alright, so now that we know how to read files, how do we create one?

The answer is <touch>.

As you've probably already guessed, you can use the command like this: <touch myfile>, which will create <myfile> in your current directory.

Of course, you can also create files in other directories, just like you change directories. For example, you can use <touch /myfile> to create <myfile> in your <root> directory.
